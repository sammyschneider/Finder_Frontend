Full-Stack Food app inspired by Tinder -- "The Tinder for food". Users can swipe on food around them to see what they are craving! Swiping right on a particular restaraunt adds that to the database. Swiping left means pass for now and on to the next option!

Stack: Backend --> Python/Django, Frontend --> React, Database --> PostgreSQL

Functionality to be added: User Auth

Issues: App sometimes doesn't work because of API limitations (# of requests)
